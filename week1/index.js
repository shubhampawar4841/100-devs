// Compiler convert high level developer code into 0s and 1s
// Javascript is Interpreted code so it doesnt have compilation time
/

//Compiled Language => first need to compile anf then run and usallay dont compile if there is a error in code
Example => C++, Java, Rust, Golang

//Interpreted Language => Usually Line to line 
// can run partially if error comes later 
Example Javascript Python

//Static vs Dyanamic 

//static => strict 
// dynamic => loosely types

//Single Threaded nature of JS
// In single-threaded applications, there is only one thread of execution. This thread processes tasks or instructions one after the other, without multitasking.

const a=1;

console.log(a);

//VAR
// var is the oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript. It has been part of the language since its inception, but due to some of its quirks, itâ€™s less commonly used in modern JavaScript.
